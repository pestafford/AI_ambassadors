# AI Ambassadorship & Outreach
## 🌍 Bridging the Gap Between AI and the Next Generation

Too many young people are rejecting AI outright, missing out on opportunities to shape its future. This project is about changing that.

We're building an open-source initiative to engage, educate, and empower students and communities to see AI as a tool they can harness rather than fear. Our goal is to provide resources, mentorship, and real-world applications that showcase AI’s potential in a way that resonates with different audiences.#
