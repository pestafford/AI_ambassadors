# You’re Not Scared of AI, You’re Scared of Losing Yourself

It was just a quiet Saturday. Nothing dramatic about it. I was sitting nearby, and she was focused, steady. There was a calm in the room, but something about the way she carried herself — intentional, aware — made it clear she wasn’t just passing time.

The conversation started light. Music, TikTok trends, things most people talk about when there’s nothing pressing.

But then, halfway through the exchange, she paused. The silence between us stretched a little longer than usual, and when she spoke, it was like the air in the room shifted.

“I mean, I guess if I had to use it for work, I would… but it just makes me feel like, what’s the point of having a creative job at all? I know how to write a text. I know how to draw. I can do things.”

She didn’t say it as a complaint.

She said it like someone speaking a truth they hadn’t fully processed yet, a truth that didn’t feel like it was theirs to express, but came out anyway.

I didn’t answer right away. I didn’t have to.

I’ve been in tech for decades, through the cycles of hype, new tools, new promises. I’ve seen it all — the rise, the fall, the certainty of innovation, followed by the hollowing out of something essential.

So when she said those words, I heard something more than just frustration.

I heard the same quiet dread I’d carried for a long time — the fear that the things we value might disappear, not in a moment, but little by little.

She went on:

“I know it can be a tool. But it’s not like it does anything I can’t do. It just… does it faster. And everyone’s acting like that’s better. But it’s not. It just feels worse. It feels like… I don’t know… dystopian?”

She said that word carefully, like it wasn’t one she used lightly.

Still, I didn’t interrupt. I just listened.

Because I understood.

This wasn’t about AI.

This was about grief.

Not dramatic, teary-eyed grief. Not collapse. Not the kind that gets a eulogy.

This was the quieter kind. The slow-burn kind. The kind that settles in your chest when you realize the future you imagined for yourself might not exist. That all the time you spent becoming someone might be met with silence. Or worse — indifference.

She was grieving the loss of meaning.

Of process.

Of being necessary.

And here’s what’s wild: she’s not alone. This is the emotional undercurrent humming through an entire generation of young people. Gen Z, younger Millennials, even some Gen X like me. This feeling that we’ve all been handed a fast-forward button and told, press it or perish.

We tell them to “adapt or fall behind.” But adapt to what, exactly?

To a system that treats their originality as inefficiency?

To a future that says the things they spent their lives practicing — writing, art, code, emotion, analysis — can all be “streamlined” into a prompt box?

We talk about AI resistance like it’s some silly tantrum.

But that’s not what it is.

It’s mourning.

It’s mourning.

And we’re not just doing them a disservice by ignoring it. We’re doing ourselves one.

Because if they’re grieving the loss of meaning, it’s only because they still remember what meaning felt like.

And that makes them some of the last, best torchbearers we’ve got.

So when she looked at me, waiting to see if I was going to push her toward embracing it or dismiss her as scared…

I didn’t.

I just nodded.

Because I get it.

Because she’s not wrong.

You’re not wrong to hate it.

You’re not wrong to miss something that hasn’t even fully disappeared yet.

You’re not wrong to want your effort to mean something.

You’re not wrong to hold the line on what makes you feel human.

We are told AI is coming for our jobs. But that’s not what they’re afraid of.

They’re afraid it’s coming for our value.

For our stories.

For our souls.

And if they’re drawing the line there?

Then honestly — thank God someone is.

Here’s the thing: we can’t afford to let this be a passing moment.

This grief, this resistance — it’s not some fleeting trend. It’s a sign. A signal we can’t ignore. Because when an entire generation is wrestling with the loss of meaning, we have to ask ourselves: What are we letting slip away? What are we willing to lose in the name of efficiency and convenience?

If we’re going to fix this, we need to do more than talk. We need to act.

We need to push back against the narrative that originality, creativity, and the messy, human process of creation aren’t valuable. We need to make space for things that aren’t easily automated. We need to remind ourselves (and others) that what makes us human isn’t the speed at which we can churn out results, but the depth and meaning behind them.

So, if you’re feeling that grief too, that sense of losing something you can’t quite define, don’t let it stay buried. Speak up. Draw the line. Let’s make sure the things that make us human are worth more than just a prompt box and a few milliseconds of machine efficiency.

It’s time we fought for what truly matters. For meaning. For the work that makes us whole. For the stories that are ours to tell.

And yes, we can draw that line — together.
